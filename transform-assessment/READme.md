# Debug Transform

We built `transform` but it does not work. Why? Debugging time! You are tasked with walking through the code, finding/fixing possible errors and correcting anything that does not follow engineering best practices.

Please do this problem without referring back to exactly how we built transform in previous sprints/slides.

* [X] Build `loop` (or copy what you wrote in the Extend Obj prompt to define loop here).

* [X] Debug `transform`.

* [X] Test your `transform` function using the test case given.
